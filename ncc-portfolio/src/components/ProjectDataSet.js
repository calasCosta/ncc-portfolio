        description: `which aims to familiarize with the administration of relational 
        databases using SQLServer, through the implementation of a new system for grouping schools named "Agrupamento STB".
        One of the measures adopted by the group is to develop a new information system that allows it to manage, in an integrated way,
        the entire process of launching grades of the different schools in the grouping, as well as allowing students and guardians to
        have access to this information.
        With the implementation of the new system, it became necessary to model and integrate, in a new Database, the pieces of information
        that were exported from existing systems and that up to now supported the various schools in the cluster. The main concepts used
        were Programming (Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers), Metadata, Indexes, Backup and Recovery, Access levels, Encryption, and
        transaction control.`,

        Throughout the project, the following several abstract data types were used: ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedHashMap. We also used data types
        by us implemented as following shown: Graph, GraphAdjacencyList, Vertex and Edge. Referring to Design Patterns, we used: Observer Pattern,
        Strategy Pattern, MVC Pattern. We also used refactoring techniques to avoid bad smells in the program.`,
